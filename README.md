### Hi there, I'm Gariel ðŸ‘‹
I am a second year computer science student at the University of Guelph with a passion for coding and software development. As an aspiring software engineer, I have a strong foundation in programming languages such as C, Java, Python, HTML/CSS, SQL, and JavaScript. I am currently learning full-stack development and am excited about the potential it offers for me to grow. I hope to explore the fields of AI and machine learning, as I believe these technologies have the potential to create positive change in the world. I am eager to gain practical experience through internships and contribute to innovative projects that make an impact.
